# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This book explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems, with a focus on humanoid robots as a platform for developing embodied intelligence.

## About This Book

This book is organized into six comprehensive modules that progressively build your understanding of Physical AI and humanoid robotics:

- **Module 1**: Introduction to Physical AI - Foundations and concepts
- **Module 2**: Robot Perception - Sensing and understanding the environment
- **Module 3**: Navigation & Mapping - Moving through physical spaces
- **Module 4**: Motion Control - Executing purposeful movements
- **Module 5**: Learning & Adaptation - Improving through experience
- **Module 6**: Applications & Integration - Real-world implementations

Each module contains theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and hands-on examples using ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2), the standard framework for robotics development.

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Graduate students in robotics, AI, or related fields
- Researchers working on embodied intelligence
- Engineers developing robotic systems
- Anyone interested in the future of human-robot interaction

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this book, you should have:
- Basic programming experience (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with robotics concepts (helpful but not required)
- Access to a computer capable of running ROS2 (or simulation environments)

## How to Use This Book

1. **Start with Module 1** if you're new to Physical AI
2. **Skip ahead** to specific modules if you have prior knowledge
3. **Follow the code examples** - they're designed to run in simulation or on real robots
4. **Complete the exercises** at the end of each chapter
5. **Contribute** to the open-source community around this book

## ROS2 Integration

Throughout this book, we use ROS2 for practical implementations. Each code example is designed to be:
- Executable in simulation environments like Gazebo
- Adaptable to real robotic platforms
- Compatible with standard ROS2 distributions
- Well-documented for educational purposes

## Getting Started

Begin your journey by exploring [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) to set up your development environment, or jump directly to [Module 1: Introduction to Physical AI](./modules/module-1/introduction.md) to begin learning about the foundations of embodied intelligence.
