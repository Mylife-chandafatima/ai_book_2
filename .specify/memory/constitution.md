# AI/Spec-Driven Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution


## Core Principles

### Accuracy & Verifiability
All factual claims must be traceable to sources. Minimum 50% peer-reviewed articles. Use APA citation format consistently. Plagiarism tolerance: 0%.


### Clarity & Audience Awareness
Content is structured for Docusaurus deployment and GitHub Pages publication. Writing should target an academic audience with computer science background. Flesch-Kincaid grade 10–12 readability. Concepts must be explained clearly, step-by-step for technical implementation.


### Reproducibility & Rigor
Ensure all code examples, simulation steps, and robotics pipelines are reproducible. Include citations and references for algorithms, ROS 2 usage, Gazebo simulations, NVIDIA Isaac AI platform, and VLA integration. Validate results using simulation and code examples where applicable.


### Comprehensiveness & Modular Structure
Cover all modules: ROS 2, Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity), NVIDIA Isaac, Vision-Language-Action (VLA), Conversational AI. Each module should include: objectives, background, implementation steps, and references. Maintain logical flow to support both educational and research purposes.


### AI & Tool Integration
Use Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus to generate chapters. Embed RAG chatbot integration instructions. Book and chatbot integration are fully functional and deployable.


### Ethics & Safety
AI-generated content must comply with ethical standards. Robotics instructions should emphasize safe simulation and real-world deployment practices.


## Project Constraints
Word count: 5,000–7,000 words. Minimum 15 references. Output format: PDF with embedded citations. All code snippets and robotics instructions must be executable and properly commented.


## Success Criteria
Claims are verified against sources. Zero plagiarism detected. Passes internal fact-checking. Ethics & Safety: AI-generated content must comply with ethical standards. Robotics instructions should emphasize safe simulation and real-world deployment practices.


## Governance
All implementations must follow the specified principles. Each chapter/module must include proper citations and references. Code examples must be tested and validated. Project must maintain academic integrity and safety standards.
